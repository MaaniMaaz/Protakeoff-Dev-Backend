# Order Confirmation Email Feature

## Overview

This feature automatically sends order confirmation emails to customers when their order is successfully completed. The email includes:

- Order details (ID, date, status)
- List of purchased items with prices
- Download links for all purchased files
- Professional HTML email template with responsive design

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Email Trigger
When a customer completes a purchase through the cart checkout process, the system automatically:
- Creates the order in the database
- Sends an order confirmation email to the customer
- Includes all cart details and download links

### 2. Email Content
The email contains:
- **Order Summary**: Order ID, date, and status
- **Items Purchased**: Each takeoff with title, price, and file downloads
- **Download Links**: Direct links to all purchased files via Cloudinary
- **Total Amount**: Final order total
- **Professional Styling**: Responsive HTML email with ProTakeoff branding

### 3. File Downloads
- All files are stored on Cloudinary
- Direct download links are provided in the email
- Links remain active for customer convenience
- Files are organized by takeoff item

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified
1. **`utils/email.js`**

   - Handles both HTML and plain text versions

2. **`routes/cart.js`**
   - Modified checkout route to send email after successful order
   - Email sending is non-blocking (order succeeds even if email fails)

3. **`controllers/orderController.js`**
   - Added `resendOrderEmail()` function for admin use
   - Allows resending emails if needed

4. **`routes/order.js`**

## Environment Variables Required

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM=your-email@gmail.com
```

## Testing

### Test Script
Run the test script to verify email functionality:

```bash
node test-order-email.js
```

This will:
- Check email configuration
- Send a test order confirmation email
- Provide feedback on success/failure

### Manual Testing
1. Complete a test purchase through the frontend
2. Check customer email for order confirmation
3. Verify download links work correctly
4. Test email on different devices/clients

## Admin Features

### Resend Email
Admins can resend order confirmation emails:
- **Endpoint**: `POST /api/order/resend-email/:orderId`
- **Authentication**: Requires admin token
- **Use Case**: If original email failed or customer requests resend

## Error Handling

- Email failures don't prevent order completion
- Detailed error logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful fallbacks for missing data
- Non-blocking email sending

## Security Considerations

- Email credentials stored in environment variables
- No sensitive data in email content
- Download links use Cloudinary's secure URLs
- Email sending is isolated from order processing

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Email templates for different order statuses
- PDF invoice attachments
- Email preferences for customers
- Email tracking and analytics
- Multi-language support
